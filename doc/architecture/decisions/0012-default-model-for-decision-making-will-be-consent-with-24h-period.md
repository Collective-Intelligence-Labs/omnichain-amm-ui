# 12. Default model for decision making will be consent with 24h period

Date: 2023-09-10

## Status

Accepted

## Context

This is the most optimal model for the v1. because it's simple and easy to implement, no need to calcualte percentage and so on, also we use consent not consensus because it's more optimal in terms of penalizing those who do not pay attemtion to the vote, and saves the memory from extra singnature data. Moreover we have to use a period anyway, even in consensus allowing proposals to be infinite does not sounds reasonable.

## Decision

The change that we're proposing or have agreed to implement.

## Consequences

What becomes easier or more difficult to do and any risks introduced by the change that will need to be mitigated.
